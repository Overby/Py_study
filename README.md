In this exercise, I am working toward a page that displays a few select movies that will display
poster art and whose trailers will be available for watching if the poster images are clicked.
This task will utilize a Movie class containing within it several instances that correspond to
each movie. It imports and uses both the given Fresh Tomatoes and Webbrowser modules.
